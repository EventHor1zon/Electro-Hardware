My First PiHAT

Based (in part) on the Juicebox PiHAT. 

Provides capability to power a Raspberry Pi Zero W using rechargeable LiPo Battery. Also adds pins for using an SD3306 OLED screen, 6 buttons for navigation & interaction,
hardware to emulate the TV-BE-GONE, stsus LEDs and low-power shutdown.

Designed to be loaded with Broadcom drivers (to add Monitor mode to the Wireless interface), an external antenna and lots of fun scripts to run.

ALL HAIL THE Pen-Pi
